====================================
======Abstract of DOCK system=======
====================================
THe DOCK system is a high level software integration program for general Cubesat mission analysis.
The purpose of DOCK system is to create friendly interface in order to make user easily test all necessary program/software.


====================================
===========Functionality============
====================================
In Version 1.3, DOCK system provides several functions listed as follows: ("[]" means it is a module)
1.[Scenario-check] Checking and analyzing parameters among "Scenario", "Configuration" files and specificed VTS project files.
2.[EASYQUAT] Generate Easy-quaternion CIC file if needed. (Sequence inputs is supported as well.) 
3.[PRODQUAT] RUN the Scilab/Xcox to generate dynamic model based quaternion file. 
4.[PRODVTS] Create new VTS project file if needed.
5.[EXEVTS] Execute VTS (This function will check if there is a new created VTS project file or not).

Notice: Users can decide which module should be executed in "Scenario" file, except the fist one, since [Scenario-check] is the
	most important module in DOCK, without it, all the other modules can not work successfully. 

====================================
========System Requirements=========
====================================
In order to get good result of DOCK system, the user should meet all requirements described below before launching the DOCK system.
[Please see "MGT-009" to find detail steps]
1. The DOCK system was developed by Shell script, so it can only be executed in Linux environment (recommend Ubuntu 14.04).
2. Install Scilab/Xcos
3. Install Octave 
4. Install Vts-Linux-32bits (Can be downloaded from CNES website: http://www.timeloop.fr/vts/en/index.html)
5. Make sure the VTS can execute "Celestia" without problems, if not, please follow the tutorial for fixing this problem in Technical Note.


====================================
=======How to use DOCK System=======
====================================
1.Go to "Input" folder, you will see four files, they are "Scenario", "Configuration", "sed_inputs" and "PFM-002_Birdy_1.5.xml" files.
  For "Scenario" and "Configuration" files: Define parameters properly in these two files. 
  Notice: 
	1. All parameters related to file location support both absolute & relative path.
	2. If the user define the same parameter twice or more times in the same "Scenario" or "Configuration" file, 
	   the DOCK will use the final defined one.
	3. The empty space between parameter name and "=" symbolm is un constrained, so it means that:
	   both  Silent_mode        = "True"  &   Silent_mode= "True"  are acceptable by DOCK  

2.If needed, describe sequence inputs for [EASYQUAT] module in "sed_inputs" file.

3.DOCK can also check data from IDM-CIC project file, if the user want to use this function, remember to define the "IDM_CIC_file" in Scenario file.

4.After defining all necessary parameters, the user can decide which module will be executed in this time through the "Module Selection" in Scenario file.
  For example, if the user don't want to execute the "PRODQUAT" module, just add a marker like "#" in front of "PRODQUAT" name. Like #PRODQUAT

5.Open a new Terminal, and change the directory to the DOCK main folder, e.g. (do not type the symbol "$")
  $ cd LOCATION_OF_DOCK

6.Execute the DOCK by following commands:(do not type the symbol "$")
  $ ./dock YOUR_SCENARIO_IN_INPUT_FOLDER
  or
  $ ./dock THE_ABSOLUTE_PATH_OF_SCENARIO
  or even 
  $ ./dock

  for example:
  $ ./dock BIRDY_scenario
  $ ./dock home/birdy/Software/DOCK_v1-3/Input/BIRDY_scenario
  These two commands listed above are the same.
  In addition, if the user only type "./dock", the DOCK will require you to enter the Scenario file.
  Again, in this situation, both absolute and relative path are acceptable.

7.About the result, the user can find latest generated files in "Output" folder as well as log files.
